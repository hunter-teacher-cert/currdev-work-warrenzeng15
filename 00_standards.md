### NY State standards:  

9-12.IC.6, 9-12.IC.7, 9-12.CT.4, 9-12.CT.6, 9-12.CT.7, 9-12.CT.8, 9-12.CT.9, 9-12.CT.10, 9-12.DL.2  
I may have missed some, but generally a course like this has a very wide breadth and will touch upon many of these standards in the process. 

### Motivation:
Game developement is something that a lot of younger students can get into, and is also a gateway for many people to get into computer science in the first place. I think there are a lot of interesting topics that could be covered in a game development class, and a lot of them will involve programming.
Ideally, either the entire class would work together on one game throughout the year, or the teacher could split the class up into a few large groups which work on their own game projects throughout the year. As the year progresses and students learn more and more about the different asepcts of game development,
their game will slowy but surely evolve into something better and better. It would make for an excellent final project for these group(s) of students to be bale to deliver a fleshed out, playable game at the end of the year that they can share with students at the school.
  
There are also a bunch of potential topics that have less to do with programming as well, such as artists and graphics designers, as well as soundtrack composers and sound effects people. There are also opportunities for more discussion based topics --I think it would be interesting to have a class of students to 
talk through things like game monetization and games as a service, as well as give their opinons on how the different aspects of game development would be split between a group of developers. This gives the class a lot of variety, as it is not strictly just learning about how to program in a gaming setting. By adding 
all this variety in the topics that are covered in the class, students can express themselves better and find more ways to be creative, which makes it perfect as an elective class that feels non-academic, but at the same time supports a very high amount of learning. As I mentioned before, 
the course would cover a very wide breadth (to the point where it would actually make sense to cut it down and make it smaller), which means that it will touch upon many of the learning standards for computer science. 

All in all, I think a class like this would require a lot of behind the scenes work on the teacher's part, as they will have to familiarize themselves with the game development process, and probably try developing at least a small-scale game on their own before they bring it to a class of high school students.
Personally, I don't actually see myself being able to teach a class like this at least for a few years (until I have more experience as a teacher, and have had time to practice/learn aabout game development on my own outside of school). After having written and fleshed out my idea in the assignment, I've realized that 
it truly does encompass a lot, and may be very hard to contain in just one school year. Creating a game in the limited timespan of one school year would be a tough task even more experienced game developers, which means it will be even more difficult for students that are just starting their journey in learning game development.
