## Game Design course
### 6 units:
### 1. Game programming 
- Contains actual programming, probably with a set programming language/software (like gamemaker studio2,  for example).
- As such, it is important that this is the first unit, as it is the building blocks for the course. It sets up an enviornment for students to produce something (if necessary) for future units as well.
- No necessaray prior knowledge, as everyone will be starting from the very beginning. This is another reason why this unit works well as the first one.
- This will likely be the majority of the course as the biggest/longest unit, alongside Unit 2

### 2. Game feel/Gameplay loop 
- Covers what the gameplay is like, how the students as the developers wants the players to feel/react
- Showcase if the many, many different kinds of game genres there are. Complex ones will probably be very difficult to implement in the class, so students will probably make simple one(s) for their assignments/projects in this unit.
- Good segue from Unit 1, as it is taking the skills they learned in unit 1 and formulating them into a concrete design suitable for a game.

### 3. Story/themes and Art 
- Good segue after units 1 and 2 -- students are now able to build a functioning game/gameplay, so now they need to give it context.
- Discuss the storyline of a game and how to tie it to the gameplay/themes of the game. 
- In terms of art, this could be pixel art or just a part of incorporating visual arts from outside, into the game. 
- Can be theoretical/analyzing art of existing games, or a hands-on project where students develop an art style for a game they've built already. This would mean that the prior knowledge for this unit would be making sure that students are comfortable with game programming software (Unit 1 content).
- Discussion of soundtracks/music/sfx. The scope of the class will likely not include actually creating music from scratch for student's games, but it is important that students learn how music fits into games.

### 4. User interface/experience and accessibility 
- Design good user interfaces, as well as thinking about accessibility options in games.
- A lot of this unit will be having students put themselves in the shoes of a player and not the developer, to see if they can find it "fun/enjoyable". This can be done by having students play each other's games and then give feedback.
- Potentially the smallest unit in size -- there may be more points to cover in order to flesh out this unit that I may come up with later.
- Good segue point after unit 3 -- the standard parts of a game have all been covered at this point, so this is sort of a unit to do a bit of refinement/polishing of what students have created/are able to create. 

### 5. Videogame industry as a whole. 
- Natural place to shift gears from Units 1-4, which are all about the basics of building a game. This unit instead is more of a macro focus on videogames as whole, so that students can learn from what's currently out there/successful projects/etc.
- Discussion of various topics such as monetization, games as a service, playtesting/debugging, community building (discords/forums/twitter), PR, marketing. feedback, game reviews/video game journalism, etc.
- AAA studios, AA studios, indie studios, etc. (Students can think about future career paths here if they would like)
- Make time for current events/interesting changes in the industry
- At the end, student groups will present a TedTalk/some sort of presentation related to the industry that they find interesting. It will be sort of a deep dive so that other students can learn from it as well.


### 6. Final project: Make your own game/Protoype a game
- The last big project of the class should be for students to create their own game, using all the knowledge they've acquired throughout the course. 
- Students can use inspiration from the previous unit in their development to decide on the type of game they want to start designing.
- Students will work in large groups so that they can cover more ground. They will be expected to incorporate all of the previous units skills/knowledge.
(decide on the gameplay/genre and be able to program some if not all of it, fit in a story to the game as well as come up with the art that will be used, and also to take into consideration the user experience/user interface and any accessbility options they can/should include).
- This unit can sort of be introduced early/be done alongside with Unit 5, as unit 5 does not require any deliverable work involving programming/game creation. This would give students more time to put together their final project.

I sort of discussed the reasons why I ordered these units they way that I did in their descriptions, but I will summarize them here.    
  
I've broken down the course into 6 units, although it is really more like 5 as the last unit is simply time for students to work on a final project to make a game/deliver a prototype. The first unit is the programming one, where students will start from scratch and learn a new environment to create a game.
This will be a tutorial on the building blocks of course, which is why it is imperative that it is first. It segues nicely into the second unit, where students learn the way that proper gameplay/game feel is structured in a game. By combining their knowledge in Unit 1, they should be able to create rough/basic
versions of games in a variety of genres, or at least know how to create them. This naturally leads to the next unit which focuses on story and art, which are simply ways to give their game more context and make them bigger than just a basic game program.   
  
Unit 4 follows the past 3 units up by refining/polishing off what students have built and making it more accessible/user friendly. The first 3 units cover all the basics, and Unit 4 is where students begin to think about presentation rather than just the innerworkings of the game.
The last unit with new content will be Unit 5, which is where we shift gears into talking about the videogame industry as a whole, sort of at a macro level. This is a place to give students some breathing room from having to program/create, as well as a way for them to analyze successful videogames
and discuss a wide variety of topics of videogames which may or may not be applicable to their own creations/their future careers. 

Unit 6 is simply a unit for students to work on a final project. They can choose to create a game using all of the knowledge/skills they've obtained in the course, or if the scope of their game would require work beyond the time constraint of the class (or even just a constraint on what they can accomplish themselves), 
they can instead opt to simply make a prototype but still draft all of the other details of the game (story/art/gameplay/presentation). I think this would be a good way to end the course, as students will be able to create a big project that they want to work on. As I stated above, the start of the final project could happen 
alongside Unit 5, so that students can begin to work on their project earlier. Unit 5 will likely not require any programming/creation on it's own, so it makes sense to at least introduce the project early on and allow students to begin working on it slowly.

  
#### Note: I may decide to change the course that I work with later on, as I think it may be difficult for me to design lesson plans on these topics at the moment.
