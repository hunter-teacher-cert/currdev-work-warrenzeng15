#### Language to be used for a Game Design class: Javascript with [RPG Paper Maker](https://rpg-paper-maker.com/)

Quick list of Strengths:  
- Free for non-commercial use ($75 to upgrade to commercial use version)
- Compatible with visual studio code (which is recommended to use. This would be the programming environment I would use for the class, as well as the RPG Paper Maker software obviously)
- Very beginner friendly, you can accomplish a lot even without programming/3d modeling/pixel art. Programming knowledge allows you to create/modify javascript plugins. 
- Lends itself well to focusing on some of the units in the class, particularly the story/art one. 

I chose this language as the primary one because of how simple it seemed to be in order to get started. The programming enviornment seems robust but still beginner friendly, and there seems to be a focus on 2d environments/RPG style games. 
There are a lot of existing modules and support for plugins/scripts, so it looks like wouldn't take a long time for students to create something functional that looks good. As I stated above, this makes it ideal for the story/art unit in the game design class. RPGs tend to have basic gameplay, which 
allows more time for the class to spend on writing story and designing the art and visual aspects/environments for their game, instead of spending a lot of time focusing on the actual programming of it. In short, RPG Paper Maker allows for a narrowing of the scope of the course, which could be really helpful 
if students need more time to work on projects. This also means that the variety of gameplay types are a little narrower, as most projects will likely turn out to be RPG games (probably with some variation of turn-based combat).  
Javascript as the language being used is also a strength -- it is a language that will translate well to/from building web pages. Students may already have experience with it, and even if they don't, they will be learning something that can be applied elsewhere.

The biggest weakness seems to be that there is not a lot of support for RPG Paper Maker. There is a github with a lot of documentation, but some of it is incomplete/outdated. It does still have a good beginner guide on the website, however, which should be sufficient for getting started and making basic games.
I think the way I can mitigate this is to heavily scaffold projects. This would mean that students have less of an opportunity to be creative, but the plus side would be that there would be less troubleshooting on the teacher's part. It also allows for the teacher to build their lessons to
 focus on the content of the Game Design curriculum. 

Overall, I think RPG Paper Maker would be my top pick. The Game Design course that I've been working on is not supposed to focus entirely on the actual programming of a game, as the scope reaches further beyond that. RPG Paper Maker is thus more ideal for a teacher to use, as it can help them 
focus down on delivering the content/material with less worrying about the nitty gritty programming parts of computer science.


#### Alternative, or if time permits, an additional programming enviornment/language could be [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/), which uses either C++, C# or it's very own "GDScript" (beginner style language taking inspiration from python)

Quick list of Strengths:  
- Free, open source
- Seems to have a bigger community, which means more support 
- Less limitations/higher skill ceiling, could allow for a wider variety of games/gameplay -- 3D games capabilities, etc.
- works in browser: https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/latest/.  This means it is more accessible across devices, which includes even chromebooks
- Also compatible with visual studio code (the programming environment that would be used alongside the Godot Engine)

Godot Engine seems pretty interesting as a more advanced language/environment (which may be preferred if the students in the class are coming with a more experienced background. I think it's also great because of the fact that it is free and open source,
which means that students could continue their project or work on a new project beyond the scope of the course, maybe even turning it into a full fledged game to be put on the market. It also uses C#/C++, advanced languages which would allow students to build their programming skills
that can transfer over to things even beyond game making. Because it doesn't seem to have a strong focus on any particular type of gameplay style, Godot also seems like it could be better to allow for a wider variety of games that students can create.   
The big weakness that I see is that Godot seems like it has more complexity, and also that C++ and C# can be much more difficult to teach/work with for high schoolers. This essentially makes it the other side of the spectrum compared to Javascript + RPG Paper Maker. One way to mitigate this is to use 
Godot with GDScript, which resembles a language like Python, an indent focused programming language with simpler syntax.

**A final alternative is GameMaker studio 2. Initially I hadn't even considered it because I remembered that there was a hefty price tag of about $100 or so, but I just discovered that they created a education version for teachers to use with students. GameMaker uses it's own language called GML and I think I would evaluate it similar to how I evaluated Godot.**
