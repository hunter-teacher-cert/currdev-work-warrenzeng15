### Email: warren.zeng15@myhunter.cuny.edu, wzeng2@schools.nyc.gov

This repository contains work done in SEDC 736, a graduate level course at Hunter College. The objective of this course was to train students on 
how to design curriculum and plan lessons according to a curriculum and unit plan. 

The main project for this class/semester was to create a full unit plan based off of a course curriculum that we had designed for our homework assignment. 
The materials that I have created for this project can be found in the "Unit Plan" folder.
