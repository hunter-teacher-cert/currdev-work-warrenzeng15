# Overview of the Videogame Industry
by Warren Zeng

*As part of the imagined "Game Design" curriculum*

-----

## General Overview
This unit's goal is to expose students to various elements of the broader video game industry, hopefully introducing them to topics/aspects that they either have not learned about before, or have never analyzed in-depth before. The unit is very much a macro-level focus on the industry and will cover topics, including but not limited to: digital storefronts/launchers, game monetization, game studio sizes (AAA, AA, indie), game marketing/PR, video game reviews/journalism, games as a service, etc. This unit also works well to promote a few digital literacy standards and promotes class discussions/conversations that you would normally not see in programming-focused computer science classes. It works well for the Game Design curriculum that I have thought up of, as it covers important details surrounding a video game that is set to release to the public and gives students an opportunity to think about a game that they are developing beyond just the game programming, art/story, etc. Students will also get to think about career paths and discuss the ethics of certain systems in the industry.

## Motivation for Unit
As I described in the general overview, this unit is a great opportunity to give students a breather from designing games on their own and instead allows room for discussion based classes/lessons. It's also vital for game developers to have context on how the video game industry works, regardless of what kind of game development related job they may want to do in the future. There are many, many aspects of the industry that are important for people to know about, but I tried to choose ones that may be relevant for students to learn about. The biggest motivation is therefore to give students knowledge that will serve them well to know in the future if they ever decide to enter the industry.

## Tools Used

- Some of the game making engines/software I looked at were RPG Paper maker and Godot, but for this unit in particular, there may not be any programming done. 
Perhaps some simple Python could be used in order to illustrate some points about the industry, which would be done in Replit
- Other written assignments/discussions will be done through Google Classroom
- Students will use Google docs/Google slides for written work and presentations
- Computer and internet connection to browse sites online
- Potentially making accounts for game launcher applications such as Steam/Epic Game Store, etc.

## Assesments

formative - 
- temperature check of room (thumbs up/down, etc.) surrounding introduction to concepts
- low stakes participation in class discussions allow for students to show their understanding 


Summative - 
- discussion posts (students discuss/write about their own feelings based on the different things they are learning, which could also be used as formative assessment to check understanding. Some of these will also be ethics debates)
- final presentation that involves students going deeper into a subject related to the video game industry
