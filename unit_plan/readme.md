# Overview of the Videogame Industry
by Warren Zeng

*As part of the imagined "Game Design" curriculum*

-----

## General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)



---

## Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)

---

## Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)



---

## Tools Used
(include programming language(s), specific programs/environments, and other tools (digital or otherwise) if necessary)

- Some of the game making engines/software I looked at were RPG Paper maker and Godot, but for this unit in particular, there may not be any programming done. 
Perhaps some simple Python could be used in order to illustrate some points about the industry, which would be done in Replit
- Other written assignments/discussions will be done through Google Classroom
- Students will use Google docs/Google slides for written work and presentations

## Lessons
Total length: 2 Weeks?

(list each lesson with main topic(s))


- AAA studios vs AA studios vs indie studios

- Game monetization (1 instrucional day)

- Games as a Service lesson (1 instructional day)

- Final project - Create some sort of presentation (3-5 instructional days, which is including time for student presentations to the whole class)


---

## Assesments
(list summative and/or formative assessments used)

formative - 
(nothing specific at the moment, but I think I would like to assignments throughout the unit where students discuss/write about their own feelings based on 
the different things they are learning, which would be used as a formative assessment so that I as the teacher can check their understanding)


Summative - final presentation  
maybe some sort of final paper?
