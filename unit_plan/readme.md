# Overview of the Videogame Industry
by Warren Zeng

*As part of the imagined "Game Design" curriculum*

-----

## General Overview
This unit's goal is to expose students to various elements of the broader video game industry, hopefully introducing them to topics/aspects that they either have not learned about before, or have never analyzed before. The unit is very much a macro-level focus on the industry and will cover topics, including but not limited to: digital storefronts/launchers, game monetization, game studio sizes (AAA, AA, indie), game marketing/PR, video game reviews/journalism, games as a service, etc. This unit also works well to promote a few digital literacy standards and promotes class discussions/conversations that you would normally not see in programming-focused computer science classes. It works well for the Game Design curriculum that I have thought up of, as it covers important details surrounding a video game that is set to release to the public and gives students an opportunity to think about a game that they are developing beyond just the game programming, art/story, etc.

## Motivation for Unit
As I described in the general overview, this unit is a great opportunity to give students a breather from designing games on their own and instead allows room for discussion based classes/lessons. It's also vital for game developers to have context on how the video game industry works, regardless of what kind of game development related job they may want to do in the future. There are many, many aspects of the industry that are important for people to know about, but I tried to choose ones that may be relevant for students to learn about. The biggest motivation is therefore to give students knowledge that will serve them well to know in the future if they ever decide to enter the industry.

## Tools Used

- Some of the game making engines/software I looked at were RPG Paper maker and Godot, but for this unit in particular, there may not be any programming done. 
Perhaps some simple Python could be used in order to illustrate some points about the industry, which would be done in Replit
- Other written assignments/discussions will be done through Google Classroom
- Students will use Google docs/Google slides for written work and presentations
- Computer and internet connection to browse sites online
- Potentially making accounts for game launcher applications such as Steam/Epic Game Store, etc.

## Lessons
Total length: 2 Weeks?  
Order may change

- Digital storefronts/launchers (Steam, Epic game store, Riot Games client, xbox/playtstation stores, App store/Google Play)  (1 instructional day)

- AAA studios vs AA studios vs indie studios (1 instructional day)

- Game monetization/Free 2 play (1 instrucional day)

- Marketing, PR and Community building (1 instructional day)

- Video game journalism/reviews (1 instructional day)

- Games as a Service lesson (1 instructional day)

- Final project - Create some sort of presentation related to the course (3-5 instructional days, which is including time for student presentations to the whole class)

## Assesments
(list summative and/or formative assessments used)

formative - 
(nothing specific at the moment, but I think I would like to assignments throughout the unit where students discuss/write about their own feelings based on 
the different things they are learning, which would be used as a formative assessment so that I as the teacher can check their understanding)


Summative - final presentation  
maybe some sort of final paper?
