## Tech tools for the unit

- Google Classroom 
- Google slides
- Replit/GitHub for markdown files, which then get turned to slides with [remark](https://remarkjs.com/#1)?



As this unit focuses more on presentations and reading/discussion, general educational tools should suffice for the unit. Google classroom will be where links to articles/resources will be posted, as well as where class discussions for homeworks will live. 
Google slides will be useful for class presentations, although students will be more than welcome to try converting markdown files on Replit/GitHub to slides.
