## Final Project - Group Presentation  

The final project for this unit will be a group presentation, in groups of about 3-4 students that you will get to choose on your own. 
Your group will select a topic that we have discussed previously as part of this unit and expand upon what we have already covered in this class. You may choose to analyze specific games or scenarios related to a topic, or perhaps dive deeper into analysis about a topic related to the video game industry. 
If your group wants to choose a topic that has not been covered already, please see me about it before starting your work.    
  
Remember this CANNOT simply just be a restatement of facts from our class -- many points will be taken off your grade if that turns out to be the case.

An example of this using the Games as a Service topic that we covered would be to make a presentation on one or two games of this type (ex. Fortnite, Genshin Impact, etc.), analyzing the different types of monetization that they use, the effectiveness of the games as a service model 
(you will have to research the revenue generated from the game, if applicable), the new changes/adjustments/updates that have been added to the game over time and how sucessful they have been, etc. 

The presentation can be in a variety of forms: 
- a slideshow presentation,  
- a video essay, or  
- a comedy skit/sketch

are all acceptable forms of presentation. If you have another idea, please check in with me first.

Aim to have your presentation be **7-10 minutes long.**  
Apart from delivering the presentation to the class, you will also need to hand in all the materials of your presentation to me. Any slides, documents, references or writing/planning that you have done should be turned in to me.
