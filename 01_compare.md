The two ASPCP curricula that I am going to compare are the ones from [UTeach](https://cs.uteach.utexas.edu/csp) and [Code HS - Python](https://codehs.com/uploads/f40041ef134075e10ee0106a0861abe1).
Both of these curricula pay very close attention to the AP CS A framework and make sure that they hit all 5 of the "Big ideas". They both start at a very low level, with the assumption that students have little to no prior computer science/programming expreience, but then as the course progresses, 
they begin to incorporate more and more programming, to the point where students are using Python to build things from scratch. The courses cover pretty much all of the basic Python skills that we would expect a beginner to go through, and in fact, 
there is even one python project that seems to be exactly the same -- the image filter project. 

When it comes to main differences, however, one of the most obvious is that UTeach uses Scratch as an introduction to computer programming, while Code HS uses entirely text-based languages. From a glance, it also appears that the UTeach curriculum does not have as much programming as the Code HS curriculum overall.
Several units in the UTeach curriculum seem to not have programming at all, or very, very light programming. These are great for the big ideas that are more philosophical/big picture analyzations of data/tech. UTeach also seems to be much shorter/condensed, as it only has 6 differnt units compared to Code HS's whopping 18 (granted 2 of them are basically "review for AP exam" and "do the create task for the AP exam).


Overall, I think Code HS does a better job of incorporating more of the computer programming skills that students will need (and probably want, as I would imagine that most college-level courses do not typically have students make programs with languages like Scratch). 
I think the use of the "Karel the dog" activities are a great way to introduce students to the text-based language and have them start building that skill earlier, whereas students that take the UTeach curriculum may not come out of the class as comfortable in Python.
UTeach makes talking about Big Data and future technology more interesting than Code HS. Code HS covers a lot of the material in their lessons, but I think things like the TedTalk activity in UTeach are going to be much more engaging and memorable (and usually informative) for students when it comes to discussing bigger ideas/topics.
