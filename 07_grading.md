In a perfect world, I think the grading system that I would choose would be standards based/mastery grading. This is under the assumption that the grades students will receive will not end up being translated into a number/letter grade after the fact, (which is what currently happens, and kind of defeats the purpose). The philosophy of standards based grading is that we should be evaluating/grading students based on different aspects of their performance, rather than just tieing their overall performance in the class to numbers. I think it is a much more accurate way of describing to students how proficient they are/have been at achieving the goals of the class, which is also what I believe grades should be measuring. For example, we should be measuring whether or not students are able to utilize a for loop in their program, rather than just giving them a number grade on assignments/assessments that involve for loops. Standards based grading can often be paralleled with number grades (such as Advanced = A, Proficient = B, Basic = C, etc...), but I feel that a more descriptive method feedback and a sort of pass/fail system that standards/mastery based grading can provide is better overall. 

In terms of assignments/activities and how to evaluate them that I would incorporate into the grades, I think there should be a mix of smaller formative assessments such as homeworks/worksheets, and then larger assignments such as projects and presentations where students will get evaluated the most on. The smaller formative assignments will be a way to prepare students for the larger projects/presentations, and also gives both the student and the teacher some information on where the student needs to improve in. The projects and presentations should try to resemble "real world" examples of the subject as best as it can, so that as as teacher, the evaluation that I give to them is closer to a "real world" scenario. It will also be good to have these assessments contain a variety of different standards that students can show their mastery of, which makes it more realistic. (If a student has truly mastered a skill or achieved a standard, they should be able to show this in conjunction with other skills/show it in different contexts). I want to measure how well my students would fare in the subject outside of the classroom, which is what brought me to this kind of grading system.
